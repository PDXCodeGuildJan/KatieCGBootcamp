Welcome to the best Angry Dice game on the web- that is a totally unbiased opinion, by the way! It was created to help solidify the Python conceps I have been learning over the past month. It was also the first program I wrote with Object-Oriented Programming! Hope you enjoy! 

### Dependencies
  - Python 3
 
### Deployment
1. If you haven't downloaded Python 3 already, do so here: 
https://www.python.org/downloads/ (3.5.1)
2. Download the "angry_dice.py" file from the Angry_Dice repo to your Desktop
3. Open your Terminal and type the following:
```sh
$ cd Desktop
```
4. Hit ENTER or RETURN; type the folling:

```sh
$ python3 angry_dice.py
```
5. You are now able to play Angry Dice! 

### But how do I play?!
#### Angry Dice is a game to be played by yourself or with a partner. 
	
Simply roll numbers 1-6 sequentially to win the game. There are three rounds. 

##### Round 1 Goal: roll both a 1 and a 2 to move onto round 2

Roll two dice until you roll a 1, a 2, or both a 1 and a 2. Hold one of the dies if you roll a 1 or a 2. Roll the remaining die until you roll a the remaining number you need. When you have both values you need, move on to the next round.

If you roll two angry dice, start over! 
##### Round 2 Goal: Roll both a 3 and an angry die to move onto the final round.
Very similar to round 1, roll and hold until you have an angry die and a 4. When you have both values you need, move on to the next round.
	
If you roll two angry dice, start over!

##### Round 3 Goal: Roll both a 5 and 6 to win!

You may hold a 5, but you may not hold a six. You must either roll a 5 and a 6 simultaniously, or hold a 5 before holding a six. When you have both values you need, your game ends.

If you roll two angry dice, start over! 

The first player to get through all three rounds wins!

## Enjoy!
