			<li><h3>Love Makes The World Brand New - Gareth</h3>
			<p> With lyrics like "The skyball's doing its shine thing / The moving air is so sweet" and "This flopsy colorful vine thing / Smells as pretty as meat", it takes the perfect execution to pull it off. And frankly, Vinnie Jones(Gareth) pulls it off flawlessly. There's something so charming about a evil villain singing about feelings he's never felt before, and the lyrics like "My lip-ends, look how they twist up / And hark, a laugh-sound ascends" perfectly illustrates a villain feeling love for the first time.</p>
